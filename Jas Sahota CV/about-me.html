            <p>
              Professionally I enjoy problem solving and find satisfaction when delivering a solution to a challenge people or the business may face.
              With most of my professional career as a Data Analyst using Javascript in the Google Apps Scripts space, I can competently write scripts to automate data governance processes for a central database I am responsible for.
            </p>
            <p>
              My role is to maintain a high quality of data and efficiently get live Operational data from the business to Dashboards so my stakeholders can make confident and informed decisions.
            </p>
            <p>
              The data I obtain is via an internal tool in the form of a web app built using HTML, CSS and Javascript. 
              Since the developer in my team departed 6 months ago I took the initiative to complete a Frontend Web Development course with General Assembly to maintain our platform in the organisation.
            </p>

            <p>
              I deeply enjoy web development, as it allows me to creatively build something digital and seeing the results is a great feeling.
              Keen to seek an opportunity in which I can focus solely on my improving my technical skills professionally and look forward to merging my softer business skills with technical skills is my motivation in applying for this Junior Frontend Developer role with Newmarket Holidays.
